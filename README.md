# Aleggo

![Rough screenshot of an early version.](screenshot.png)

This is a simple desktop toy for building with simple blocks. It's built with Allegro 4 with the intention of being compatible with MS-DOS.

Right now it's a very rough proof of concept. Ideally, a complete version would have more blocks, have drag and drop support, and generally be more polished.

Mouse support is broken in MS-DOS at the moment, but you can still move the grid around with the arrow keys and place blocks with the spacebar. Select the block to be placed using the number keys.
